# pi-codex-fast-mode

Request OpenAI Codex Fast mode from [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) — without changing reasoning effort, response verbosity, prompts, tools, or provider authentication.

Codex sells a faster processing tier at a higher credit rate. pi has no built-in switch for it, and its maintainers have said service tiers are [too provider-specific for core](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/4074) — an extension is the intended answer. Several already exist. This one is deliberately the narrowest of them:

```diff
  {
    "model": "gpt-5.6-sol",
+   "service_tier": "priority"
  }
```

That diff is the entire product. Everything below is about handling it carefully — because the field roughly doubles your credit burn, and the backend is free to ignore it.

> **Fast is a paid preference, not a guarantee.** The extension asks the Codex backend for Priority processing. OpenAI may reject or downgrade the requested tier, and a request hook cannot observe which tier actually served the response.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/fast` | Toggle Fast mode and save the preference |
| `/fast on` | Explicitly enable Fast mode and save the preference |
| `/fast off` | Explicitly disable Fast mode and save the preference |
| `/fast status` | Report the preference and whether it is active on this model |
| `pi --fast` | Enable for one pi process only; never written to disk |

While active on an eligible model, pi's footer shows `⚡ fast`. If the preference is on but the selected model is not eligible, it shows `⚡ fast (inactive)` and requests go out unchanged.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-codex-fast-mode
pi install ~/Dev/pi-codex-fast-mode    # local development
```

Restart pi after installing or changing the package entry. Install either the local path or the npm package, not both — duplicate discovery registers the command and hook twice.

## What it looks like

The exact text the extension emits, on `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`:

```text
❯ /fast status
Fast mode is off. This extension is not modifying provider requests.

❯ /fast
Fast mode enabled for openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol: ~1.5× speed and ~2.5× credits.
Requests ask for service_tier=priority; the backend may downgrade them.

❯ /fast
Fast mode disabled. This extension no longer modifies provider requests.
```

Switch to a model outside the eligible families and the preference survives, but nothing is sent:

```text
❯ /fast status
Fast preference is on, but openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex-spark is not eligible; requests are unchanged.
```

## When it activates, and what it costs

Both conditions must hold:

```text
provider == openai-codex
model    == /^gpt-5\.(4|5|6)(?:$|-)/ or one of gpt-6-sol, gpt-6-luna,
           gpt-6-astra, gpt-6.1-sol
```

The GPT-5 matcher accepts bare IDs and named variants such as `gpt-5.6-sol`. GPT-6 eligibility is an exact allowlist for `gpt-6-sol`, `gpt-6-luna`, `gpt-6-astra`, and `gpt-6.1-sol`; bare `gpt-6`, `gpt-6.1`, `gpt-6-future`, and other unlisted variants are excluded. This fork adds support for Sol, Luna, Astra, and GPT-6.1 Sol pending an upstream update.

| Model family | Expected speed | Credit usage |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| GPT-5.4 | about 1.5× | about 2× |
| GPT-5.5 | about 1.5× | about 2.5× |
| GPT-5.6 | about 1.5× | about 2.5× |
| GPT-6 Sol, Luna, and Astra | not specified | about 2.5× |
| GPT-6.1 Sol | not specified | about 2.5× |

These are OpenAI's published figures from the [Codex speed documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/speed), not measurements taken here, and they can change. New GPT-6 variants require an explicit eligibility and pricing review before support is added. The GPT-6 enable notification omits a numeric speed claim. This package ships no benchmarks of its own; if you run one, see the reporting bar in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

pi's separate API-key `openai` provider is intentionally excluded. Its Priority Processing has different billing and operational semantics, and should not be switched on implicitly by a ChatGPT Codex extension.

<details>
<summary>Why the wire value is <code>priority</code> and not <code>fast</code></summary>

<br/>

OpenAI's user-facing Codex configuration calls this tier `fast`. The Codex client maps both `fast` and an explicit `priority` config to `priority` on the wire — see [`ServiceTier::request_value`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/protocol/src/config_types.rs). Sending `service_tier: "fast"` would copy the configuration vocabulary rather than the actual request contract.

</details>

## What it will not do

- Change reasoning effort or `/effort` — an independent control, and conflating the two would make `/fast off` misleading.
- Change `text.verbosity`. Shorter output is faster, but it is not what Fast mode means.
- Wrap or replace pi's `openai-codex` provider. Replacing it would mean owning authentication, streaming, model catalogs, and usage accounting.
- Read or modify OAuth credentials.
- Log prompts, responses, request payloads, or headers — in any mode.
- Make network calls of its own, or spawn subprocesses.
- Claim the backend honored the tier it asked for.

## Safety model

- **Off by default, with visible paid activation.** Missing, malformed, or future-version state defaults to off. Toggling on immediately reports the expected credit multiplier and adds the footer indicator.
- **The incoming payload is never mutated.** The hook returns a shallow copy differing by one key, and returns nothing at all when disabled or ineligible.
- **`--fast` cannot become persistent.** It applies to one process and is never written to disk.
- **No failure here blocks a request.** An unusable payload, a failed write, or an ineligible model degrades to leaving the request alone, plus a one-time warning.
- **Package-owned state.** The preference lives in `<pi-agent-dir>/state/pi-codex-fast-mode.json` (default `~/.pi/agent`), written through an exclusive temporary file and renamed into place — never by read-modify-write on pi's shared `settings.json`. Windows uses a documented, explicitly non-atomic fallback whose worst case is absent state, which reads as off.

## Conflicts

Do not run this alongside another extension that registers `/fast` or sets `service_tier`. pi executes provider hooks in load order, so whichever runs last decides the value. If this extension finds a different tier already on the payload it replaces it and warns once per session — that makes the collision visible, it does not make the combination safe.

## Compatibility

Developed and live-tested against pi 0.82.1. Requires `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent >=0.82.0` as a peer, and Node.js 22.19 or newer. It depends only on the public extension API — `before_provider_request`, command and flag registration, and `ctx.model` — not on provider internals.

## Development

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run release:check
```

The release check runs formatting and linting, strict TypeScript, the unit and integration-style suites, a shipped-dependency audit, and an exact npm tarball allowlist. Runtime code has no third-party dependencies; pi is supplied as a peer.

The architecture and the reasoning behind each decision — including the alternatives that were rejected — are in [docs/design.md](./docs/design.md). Contribution rules are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md), and release history in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Security

pi extensions run with pi's privileges. Review the source before installing — that is three runtime files and no dependencies. This package's filesystem access is limited to its own state file, and its provider hook adds one documented field to eligible requests.
